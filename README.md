# Competitively optimal stomatal behaviour
**"Data/"** contains data sets (.csv & .xls) from Zhou et al. (2014), Martínez-Vilalta et al. (2014) and Choat et al. (2012).  
**"Figures/"** contains all the figures produced (.pdf).  
**"Results/"** contains all the model predictions (.csv).  
**"Scripts/"** contains all the R code.  
**"Scripts/Derived variables/"** contains all the R code used to produce model predictions.  
**"Scripts/Figures/"** contains all the R code used to produce figures.  
  
Under **"Scripts/Derived variables/"**:  
**"/DV/"** contains all the R code used to predict  
1) Retive soil water content at stomatal closure (*w*<sub>L</sub>); 
2) Xylem water potential at stomatal closure (&#936;<sub>xmin</sub>); 
3) Xylem water potential at 50% loss of the maximum stomatal conductance (&#936;<sub>gs50</sub>) 
4) Plants’ anisohydric/isohydric behaviour (Slope) 
  
**"/g1/"** contains all the R code used to predict the relationship between *g*<sub>1</sub> and &#936;<sub>s</sub>.  
**"/gs/"** contains all the R code used to predict the relationship between *g*<sub>s</sub> and *s*  
**"SX-F.r"** contains all the functions for the corresponding scenarios. (**"SI"** stands for "Scenario I" and so on, for each of the "SX-" prefix.)
